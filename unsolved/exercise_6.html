		Exercise 6: "Coffee!"

		Write an application that allows the user to record when they drank cups of coffee (hint: try the type="datetime" input field)
		The half-life of caffeine is about 10 hours. Assuming that one cup of coffee has 95mg of caffeine,
		display in real time the amount of caffeine still present in the user's system.

		Bonus points: Allow the user to select different types of caffeinated drinks.

		Extra bonus points: display a graph showing the caffeine in the user's system since their first cup.

		Super extra bonus points: allow the user to track different types of medicines (or other chemicals) in their system as well.
