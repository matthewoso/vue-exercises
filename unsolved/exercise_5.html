		Exercise 5: "Color Mixer"
		Write an application which takes in two colors (hint: think deeply about which format you'd like to use)
		Display a block of each color (hint: background-color on a div)
		Display a block that is the "average" of the two colors (red = red1 + red2 / 2, etc.)

		{{ greeting }}
